## Performance

Although a couple of benchmarks aren't **that** good at judging performance, they're pretty cool to look at... so here's a couple.


Each benchmark was run 5 times, and the average time was taken for each language.

These tests were run on my Macbook Air 2017 with a Dual-Core i5 CPU and 8 GB RAM.

The code for the benchmarks can be found [in the test folder](https://github.com/AnonymousAAArdvark/qi/tree/master/test/benchmark).
