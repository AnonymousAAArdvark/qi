# 空 (Nil)
The value ```空``` functions similarly to ```null``` in some languages. It indicates the absence of a value. A called function/method that doesn't return anything returns a ```空``` back. ```空``` is also the default value that uninitialized variables contain.
```c
变量 uninitialized
系统。打印行（uinitialized）  // 空
```
