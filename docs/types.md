# Types

Qi is a dynamically typed programming language, which simply means that a single variable could hold any data type at different points in time. Most data types are objects, such as classes and functions. However, numbers, booleans, and nils are not objects.

The built-in types are [布尔 (boolean)](boolean.md), [数字 (number)](number.md), [空 (nil)](nil.md), [实例 (instance)](class.md), [功能 (function)](function.md), [字符串 (string)](string.md), [列表 (list)](list.md), and [类 (class)](class.md).
